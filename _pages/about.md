I am a PhD candidate undergoing joint training through the [Shanghai International College of Intellectual Property (SICIP)](https://sicip.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm) at Tongji University and the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition (MPIC)](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/), under the guidance of [Prof. Xuezhong Zhu](https://sicip.tongji.edu.cn/13/e2/c13550a136162/page.htm) and [Dr. Matthias Lamping](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/persons/lamping-matthias.html) respectively. Prior to this, I attained my Juris Master's degree from Xiamen University and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Southwest University of Political Science and Law.

My current research pursuits center around the economic analysis of innovation, with a particular focus on evaluating the effectiveness of patent systems. My doctoral thesis revolves around developing a comprehensive cost-benefit framework for patent disclosure. This encompasses an exploration of its positive externalities on a macroeconomic scale, as well as its ramifications for strategic management behaviors within firms on a microeconomic level. Furthermore, I am keen on assessing the economic impacts of patent review policies, along with the technological lock-in effect stemming from patent exclusivity within the framework of global power competition.

In my spare time, I'm also a [vlogger](https://space.bilibili.com/7688394) in Bilibili with over 26,000 followers.
