I am currently a PhD student jointly trained by [Shanghai International College of Intellectual Property (SICIP)](https://sicip.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm) of Tongji University and [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xuezhong Zhu](https://sicip.tongji.edu.cn/13/e2/c13550a136162/page.htm) and [Dr. Matthias Lamping](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/persons/lamping-matthias.html) respectively. Prior to that, I received my Juris Master's degree and Engineering Bachelor's degree from Xiamen University and Southwest University of Political Science and Law.
